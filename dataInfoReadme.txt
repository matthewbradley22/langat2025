Data in folder:
ccaIntegratedDat.rds was cca integration on unfiltered data. Not going to use for now

FilteredRpcaIntegratedDat.rds is rpca integration on filtered data which seems to separate clusters well still. Using filtered because there were many low expressing cells that I wanted to filter out anyways using knee plots, so might as well do filtered.
